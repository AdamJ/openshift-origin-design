OpenShift Origin UI Design
==========================

This repository contains design documents for the various user interfaces of OpenShift Origin. 

Repository Structure
--------------------

The repository is organized by interface and in some cases further divided by feature. Source files can be found in src/ folders where applicable.

- **Admin console** refers to the administration interface available to those maintaining an OpenShift Origin installation
- **Web console** refers to the web-based interface available to users
- **CLI** refers to the command-line interface also known as `rhc`
- **Resources** contains design resources that are interface and feature agnostic, such as Inkscape templates and symbol libraries
