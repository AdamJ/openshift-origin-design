# Helm Release Notes
After successful installation of a helm chart, users are directed to the topology view where they could see it visualized along with its components. On the topology view, the helm chart comes selected by default with the side panel showing release notes(from the associated Notes.txt file) for the respective helm chart.

Similarly, a release notes tab would also be introduced in the details page of the VM based resource. In the future users can access the notes for a given helm chart through the side-panel or the details page, under the release notes tab.
