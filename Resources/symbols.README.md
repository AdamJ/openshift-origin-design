Inkscape symbols
================

To use symbols in Inkscape, you need to be using a recent build that supports the new symbol library.

Add the symbol file to the symbol folder and restart Inkscape. The new symbol library should now be available in the symbol palette.

On Linux, the symbol folder is `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`. 

_Note:_ due to limitations in the symbol implementation, the High level symbols cannot be used in the new symbol library. In order to use it, either import it into another Inkscape document, or copy and paste the elements you need into another Inkscape document.
