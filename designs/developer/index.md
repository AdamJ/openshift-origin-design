# Developer Perspective

The Developer Perspective, added to the 4.2 OpenShift Console provides developers with an optimized experience with the features and workflows theyâ€™re most likely to need to be productive. Developers can focus on higher level abstractions like their application and components, and then drill down deeper to get to the OpenShift and Kubernetes resources that make up their application.

We strive for simplicity, while still allowing for users to achieve more advanced flows.  We focus on efficiency for those workflows that are more frequently utilized.

Our design documentation covers the entire developer experience in the OpenShift Console.  The developer experience is enhanced as operators are installed, which is also documented below.
