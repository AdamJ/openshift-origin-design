# Topology
The Topology page is a primary navigation item in the OpenShift Developer perspective.

Design documentation for the Topology section can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIld9b_mC5sGZEvHHfwflQpFZVcrrwG029egE3550kg/edit#heading=h.k3mqw09n3tkg)

[Topology is enhanced when the OpenShift Serverless operator is installed](http://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/web-console/developer/topology/topology-serverless/topology-serverless)

Links to google documents are temporary until the documentation is converted to markdown files and added to this design repository.
