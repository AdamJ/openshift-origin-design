# Container Native Virtualization (CNV)
- The first release of CNV aims to address the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt kubernetes/OpenShift but have existing VM-based workloads that cannot be containerized easily.

## Use Cases
1. As a Cluster Admin, I want to:
  - Enable KubeVirt for the cluster
  - Disable KubeVirt for the cluster
  - Update KubeVirt for the cluster
2. As a Developer, I want to:
  - Create virtual machines (VMs) and add them to my project
  - View VM specific details in OpenShift
  - Manage and take action on VMs in my project

## Design
- The following Invision prototype includes designs and flows for the use cases described above.
