# Developer

The Developer Perspective, added to the 4.2 OpenShift Console, provides developers with an optimized experience with the features and workflows theyâ€™re most likely to need to be productive. Developers can focus on higher level abstractions like their application and components, and then drill down deeper to get to the OpenShift and Kubernetes resources that make up their application.

We strive for simplicity, while still allowing for users to achieve more advanced flows.  We focus on efficiency for those workflows that are more frequently utilized.

Our design documentation covers the entire developer experience in the OpenShift Console.  The developer experience is enhanced as operators are installed, which is also documented below.

## Personas and Archetypes

## 4.5 Developer Experience
The following section documents the 4.5 OpenShift Console Developer experience.

### Primary Navigation
The primary navigation in the Developer Perspective has three main groupings: task based, object based, and an object based section of resources which have been aded to the navigation by the user.

Task based sections:
- [+Add](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/add-45/)
- [Topology](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/topology-44/)
- [Monitoring](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/monitoring-44/)
- [Search](https://https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/search-45/)

Object based sections:
- [Builds](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/builds/)
- [Pipelines](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/operator-pipeline-45/pipelines)
- [Helm](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/helm-45/)
- [Project](https://openshift.github.io/openshift-origin-design/designs/developer/project-44/)
