When `migrate` is selected the user is presented with a dialog that requires them to confirm the migration.

 After the migration had started, the status of the VM showing that the migration has started will be reflected in the list view.

On error or completion, the user will receive a notification and the status will be updated accordingly.
For a process that is not instantaneous, the user will be notified via notification when it completes.
