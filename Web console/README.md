Web console design
==================

Directory structure
-------------------

Documents are organized according to feature or workflow. Relevant source documents are located in a `src/` folder within each subdirectory. Any relevant supporting documentation is located in a `docs/' folder in each subdirectory.

Interactive source files
------------------------

Some SVG source files are also interactive prototypes. These files are indentified with `[interactive]`. In order to interact with them as prototypes:

1. Open the file in a browser.
2. Identify an interactive element by observing the cursor - interactive elements use a pointer cursor.
3. Click on an interactive element to trigger it.

See `Resources/magicmockup.README.md` for more information on how to create your own interactive SVGs.
