# Developer catalog

## The Catalog

### Categories
### Filter by type
### Filter by keyword
Filter by keyword will show cards which have a keyword match with the name or description

### Group By
The Group by dropdown allows the developer to group the tiles by operator or by none.  When grouped by operator, operators are shown as headings for each group of cards.  A Non Operators group is added for those cards which are not operator backed.

When grouped by none, tiles are just shown alphabetically by name.

### Catalog Tiles

## Create Operator Backed Services
Operators can expose items in the developer catalog for consumption by the developer.  

Operator backed services have a "Operator Backed" badge on them.  The icon on the card represents its associated operator.  If that icon isn't available then the OLM icon will be displayed.

Design documentation for creating operator backed services can be found [here](From-Catalog/Catalog-OperatorBackedService)


## Install Helm Charts
Cards which are of type Helm Chart have a "Helm Chart" badge on them.  The icon on the card represents the Helm Chart type.  If that icon isn't available then the Helm icon will be displayed.

Design documentation for installing helm charts can be found [here](From-Catalog/Catalog-HelmChart)
