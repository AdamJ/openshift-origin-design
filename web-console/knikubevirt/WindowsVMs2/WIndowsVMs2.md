# Windows VMs 2

## Licensing

At this point, it seems that we can't predetermine the licensing before a VM gets created because no Sys-Prep is available in CNV.
This means that users will first need to spin up the VM and only then provide the info.

This also affects the Windows guest tools. The user will be notified that the Windows guest tools are available and mounted as a disk.
