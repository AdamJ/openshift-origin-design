# Capitalization

This convention covers capitalization guidelines for the OpenShift console.

## Types of capitalization

The following guidelines will document when to use **sentence case** and when to use **title case** in the OpenShift console UI. To read more about the difference between them, refer to the [PatternFly capitlization documentation](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/design-guidelines/content/capitalization).

## Guidelines

Sentence case should be the default capitalization used in the console. For example, use **sentence case** for:
* Breadcrumbs
* Buttons
* Card titles
* Column headers
* Definition list items
* Empty states
* Form field labels
* Menu items
* Tabs

The following exceptions use **title case**:
* Proper nouns (including Kubernetes terminology)
* Navigation items
  * Page titles (to match navigation)
  * Breadcrumbs (only when needed to match navigation)

## Proper nouns and Kubernetes terminology

There are a number of proper nouns included in OpenShiftâ€™s terminology, including standard Kubernetes resource names. The following resources help to detail which terms are considered proper nouns:
